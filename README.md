# RateMyCourse

## Description

This web app is for the final project in Calvin University's Fall 2020 *CS-336: Web Development* course.

## Our Vision

For decades, men, women, and others have enrolled in courses with great trepidation. Many students want to prepare for their class as much as possible—both intellectually and emotionally. The traditional method is to ask upperclassmen what their experiences were like: “How was the course? What was the course load? Who was the professor? How was the professor?” Unfortunately, interrogating them isn’t always feasible, especially when the underclassmen aren’t as well-connected to the older students. Furthermore, having to repeatedly look for students who have previously taken a course is a daunting task.

*RateMyCourse* strives to facilitate the course-review process. Our web-app provides students a way to rate classes similar to which they might rate their professors. In addition, anyone—both students and professors—may see the feedback for the course. They’ll see the top three rated professors and the most frequently selected comments chosen to reflect the course. We find that the fundamental philosophy behind rating professors has flaws, and that rating a course itself may provide a more accurate assessment of how a semester might be. Our solution is to offer predefined comments; students can choose multiple ones that best reflect their experience. This acts as a safeguard from toxic and inappropriate feedback against the professors. We work to provide a better rating system for students, as well as a more professional review of educators across the board.
